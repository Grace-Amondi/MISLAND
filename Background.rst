SDG15.3.1 Indicator
-------------------

As part of the Sustainable development Goals(SDGs), SDG 15 is to: “Protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forest, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss”

Target 15.3 aims to: “By 2030, combat desertification, restore degraded land and soil, including land affected by desertification, drought, floods, and strive to achieve land degradation-neutral world”

The indicator used to assess the progress of each SDG target is the 15.3.1 indicator: “Proportion of land that is degraded over total land area’’

--------------------------
Land Degradation Indicator
--------------------------
The basic land degradation indicators include the three main sub-indicators of the SDG target 15.3.1 (proportion of land that is degraded over the total land area). As the custodian agency of SDG 15.3, the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) has developed recommendations/Good practice guide on how to compute SDG indicator 15.3.1  from 3 sub-indicators:
	• Vegetation productivity
	• Landcover
	• Soil Organic carbon
